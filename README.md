# Nodejs Reference - a repo containing config for nodejs projects

Currently includes:

* gitignore - don't check in logs, node_modules, tempfiles and the like.
* editorconfig - www.editorconfig.org - use the editor of your choice and remain consistent.
* jshint - lint javascript files - don't put style rules here
* jscs - javascript code style - command line and plugins available - (-x to write output!)

NOTE: assumes ES5 - to update for ES6 (maybe a branch or another repo)
